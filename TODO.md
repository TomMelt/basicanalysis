# Open Issues and Future Features

* Add some sanity checks:
  * Test if simulated time is less or equal to original time to detect Dimemas errors.
  * Correctly track return values of external calls and handle errors.

* Add support for compressed Paraver traces.

* Add basic threading support to run some analyses in parallel.

* Add support PyCompSs
  * Encapsulate main routines in functions
  * Provide stable switches for systems without PyCompSs
